        I started coding a lot back in 2021 during the pandemic, mainly due to a
        lack of things to do during isolation. I created my account in 2020, but
        had an older account that goes back in 2017. At first, I had a rough
        start, and didn't make some good projects, but as time went on, the
        quality of my projects increase, and right now, they are at the best
        that I can make it. I started being active around the Scratch forums in
        2021, working for shops originally. But then, I started moving into
        other things, and decided to create a collaboration known as AspectOS,
        mainly because I wanted to know how it was like creating something as a
        team. This ended up being the most successful project that I have
        created, and I haven't even released a good version yet. Generally, I do
        other stuff in the forums, such as engaging in the community and helping
        those in need. I have an estimated 7000 forum posts and counting. Last
        time I checked, I was in the top 50 list for most forum posts. In the
        announcements forum, I am number one with between 250 and 350 points.
        Since the forum closed to the public, it seems like that title isn't
        going anywhere. In my freetime, I like listening to music and playing
        video games. I think of myself as intelligent, and always find a way
        around obstacles. I am very good at procrastinating (perhaps a bit too
        well), but I always get the job done. I've gone on hiatus multiple
        times, and because of that, I've had to delay projects. But it seems
        like I won't be leaving Scratch for a while. I will continue helping the
        community and making amazing projects for my almost 500 followers. This
        website is dedicated to my Scratch career. Here, you can find projects,
        old and new, unreleased content, as well as exclusive projects that I
        don't release on Scratch due to it not being good enough. I will also
        post news here as well, in case a project gets delayed for the 10th
        time, or even canceled if I don't feel like working on it anymore. I've
        spent hours on this project, as well as my friend GPT. We've created
        this amazing website. More will be added soon, but for now, it seems
        good enough!
