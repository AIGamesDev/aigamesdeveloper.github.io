        If you are reading this, chances are that you have found the news page,
        and clicked on the little box to redirect you over here. This is where I
        will be posting my news about projects, website updates, and more. All
        of the news pages will look like this until I find a way to make it look
        better. I have a backup website which is just for experimental use, and
        I usually mess around with stuff there before adding it to the main
        website. So what exactly have I added? Well first off, the pages are the
        same like my old website. I have made some changes to the descriptions
        of those pages, and I have added/removed some content as well. In
        addition to that, I have also reworked a lot of the pages as well,
        making them as dynamic and clean as possible. I didn't do it all myself
        though, and I did use some AI for it (after all, why should I call
        myself AIGamesDeveloper if I can't use a little AI).

        I no longer have the watermark for Weebly there, and I can have my own
        custom header now. It's way easier to import links now, and I can
        customize the links as well. I can also put things where I want to put
        things without having to be restriced. So why exactly did I move away
        from a cookie-cutter website and decided to code my own website? Well
        first off, I can customize it however I want. I can have custom fonts, I
        can move around the images, and I can make it how I wanted to make it in
        my mind. And honestly, I think it's worth it. I think that I did a
        pretty good job making it. So what's next for this website?
      </p>

      <p class="text-center">
        Well first, I see that all of the images are a bit blurry. This is
        mainly due to the fact that I am currently using Scratch's image hosting
        site for thumbnails. I will try to get that fixed as soon as possible
        and upload the images directly into the website. I also want to add more
        pages as well, as well as make a download link for my projects. Before,
        I don't think I could've done it on Weebly. But for here, I think I am
        able to. I also want to be able to play projects directly from my
        website as well. I will see if I could even do that. If not, then that's
        fine. This website is already good enough. But there are a few things I
        can improve. I've failed trying to add a dark mode to my website
        multiple times, and it is getting annoying. So I will try to add if I
        could. I've always had this struggle for years, even when I started
        coding. And trust me, AI isn't helping me as well. I also want to maybe
        create a page for every project that I have created, and maybe give some
        details about it, such as when it came out, the engagement stats, why I
        decided to create the project, and a direct download to play it. Another
        thing I also want to add is some fun pages as well. Don't know what
        though, I'm still developing it. I also want to have a page to go over
        some projects that were in development, but were either cancelled or
        made into other projects. So sort of like an AIGamesDeveloper Wikipedia,
        but all of the information is confirmed to be true.
